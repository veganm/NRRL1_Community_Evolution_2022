# NRRL1_Community_Evolution_2022
Data files and code for community evolution project using communities of NRRL library bacterial strains (NRRL1)
# Files
NRRLMulti.txt (Figure 1) contains data from batch digests of worms from community-based evolution plates carried out during the initial experiment

NRRLssp.txt (Figure 2) contains individual-worm data for mono-colonization by multiple bacterial isolates

NRRLcommInvade.txt (Figure 3) contains individual worm data, CFU/worm of the pre-colonizing community members and of the invading A. aurescens

NRRLsspInvade.txt (Figure 4) contains individual worm data, CFU/worm of the pre-colonizing isolates (mono-colonization before invasion) and of the invading A. aurescens

NRRLCGkill.txt (Figure S1) contains time kill data for N2 worms on Chryseobacterium gleum

NRRLPfEvolGrowth.txt, NRRLEvolGrowth2.txt,  (Figure S2) contain plate reader data (OD600 readings taken every 10 minutes) for isolates grown in liquid NGM

NRRL1_growth_long.txt (Figure S2) contains the same data but formatted for use in growthrates()

MOmotility.txt (Figure S2) contains diameters of M. oxydans colonies on swim agar measured over time

NRRLsspInVitro.txt (Figure S3) contains data from in vitro competitions on NGM plates; note that one run of CG (run 3, 8/3/2021) started with about 100X lower GC than AA and was excluded from analysis on that basis

NRRLsspInVitroPMRatios.txt (Figure S3) contains data from in vitro experiments where P. mosselii and A. aurescens were started at different initial ratios to assess frequency dependence in the outcomes of competition

NRRL_AA_CG_InVitroTime.txt (Figure S3) contains data from in vitro experiments where CG and AA were grown together in colonies on NGM agar plates with movement to new plates every 7 days, to look at the effects of extended co-colonization on intervals similar to those used in the initial evolution experiment
